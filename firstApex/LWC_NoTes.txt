Lightning Web Componenet
-----------------------
Lightning Componenet Using two programing Models:
lightning Web Component and the orignal Model.

Lightning Web Component is Cutom Html component Built using the HTML and Modern JavaScript.

Lightning  Web Componenets and  aura Can Coexits and interoperate on a page to admins and user they both appear as Lightning components.

LWC is the ECMA7 standardization
AURA is the ECMA5 standardization


ECMA7
=============
1) Custom Elements -->
Avoid vendor type of element user neutral tech/element
e.g recom-- HTML,
Lightning-card,Lightning-buttton
<button></button> ---> neutral HTML
<lightning-button></lightning-button> ---> Custom vendor framework --AURA

2)Shadow DOM ---> Encapsulation (HTML + Lightning)
Mixture of the 2 technology is called ShadowDOM.

3)HTML Template ---> UI Frontend Should be .Html

4)ES Module ---> Use of modern JavaScript its not proprietary language
=====================================================================
To create the LWC componenet
-------------------------------
sf lightning generate component --type lwc --name myFirstLwc --output-dir 
sfdx force:auth:web:login -r https://login.salesforce.com/ 
sfdx force:source:deploy -p .\force-app\main\default\lwc\  -u yogesh@selfaura.com -w 20

@api
=====
To make the property public recactive use the api decorator.

import {api} from 'lwc';


Wire
====
call the apex method on the backend and get the result
get the records from backend.
wire is by default reactive when we want to automatic load of the records then we can use the reactive wire

syntax :

import {Wire} from 'lwc';

//wire a property
@wire(getAccountINFO,{ srcText :'$sttxt'}) wiredAccounts;

//wire a function
mydata;
myerror;
@wire(getAccountINFO,{ srcText :'$sttxt'}) function({data,error})
{
    if(data)
    {
        this.mydata =data;
    }
    else{
        this.myerror = error
    }
};
================================================================
🔥 Tricky @wire Interview Questions & Answers
Is @wire reactive or imperative?
=> @wire is reactive by default. It automatically runs when the component loads and when reactive parameters change.

Can we call @wire on button click?
=> No. @wire cannot be called manually.
For button clicks, use imperative Apex calls.

If there are multiple @wire functions, is execution order guaranteed?
=> No. Multiple @wire adapters execute independently and asynchronously.
If order is required, use reactive parameters or imperative calls.

Can one @wire call another @wire?
=> No.
But one wire can trigger another indirectly using reactive parameters ($).

Why do we use $ before a parameter in @wire?
=> $ makes the parameter reactive, so the wire re-executes automatically when the value changes.

What happens if a reactive parameter is undefined?
=> The wire does not execute until the parameter gets a valid value.

Can @wire be used with any Apex method?
=> No.
The Apex method must be annotated with:
@AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)

Can we use @wire for DML operations?
=> No.
@wire is for read-only operations only.
DML must be done imperatively.

What is the difference between wired property and wired function?
=> Wired Property	Wired Function
   Simpler	        More control
   No logic	        Custom logic
 Auto assignment	Manual assignment
// Property
@wire(getAccounts) accounts;

// Function
@wire(getAccounts)
wiredAccounts({ data, error }) {
    if (data) { this.accounts = data; }
}

Does @wire always cache data?
=> Caching works only when:
Using LDS adapters, OR
Apex method is @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true)

Can we stop a wire from running?
=> Yes, by:
Making the reactive parameter undefined or null

@wire(getAccounts, { accId: '$accountId' })
accounts;

// wire won't run if accountId is undefined

When should we avoid using @wire?
=> Avoid @wire when:
Action is user-triggered
Conditional logic is needed
Error handling is complex
DML operations are required

Is @wire synchronous or asynchronous?
=> @wire is asynchronous.

Can we refresh wired data manually?
=> Yes, using refreshApex().

Interview Killer One-Liner
=> @wire is reactive, read-only, and framework-controlled; imperative calls are manual, flexible, and developer-controlled.

LWC LDS
========
Lightning Data Service does a lot of work to make code perform well.
Loads record data progressively.
Caches results on the client.
Invalidates cache entries when dependent Salesforce data and metadata changes.
Optimizes server calls by bulkifying and reducing requests.

01. Form based
========================
a) lightning record view form ---> lightning output field
b) lightning record edit form --->  lightning input field
c) lightning record  form --->  Nothing

lightning-record-edit-form    — Displays an editable form.
lightning-record-view-form    — Displays a read-only form.
lightning-record-form         — Supports edit, view, and read-only modes.

Create Records	                Yes	 	                                   Yes
Edit Records	                Yes	 	                                   Yes

02) programing based
====================================
a) wire service --> retrival of data

b) Imperative service (direct from LWC - No apex class)
    a) create record => createRecord(recordInput)
    b) Update record => updateRecord(recordInput)
    c) Delete record => deleteRecord(recordId)
    d) get record =>

3) Server side Imperation (Apex Call)
